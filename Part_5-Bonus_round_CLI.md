# Bonus round! Use the CLI for common New Relic use-cases

The New Relic is a great way to do some common actions on the New Relic platform like setting a deployment marker, pushing custom events, or getting data with NRQL. The advantage of using the CLI is that it's a lot easier to use than a complicated curl command, and the CLI team does it best to keep all the commands working even when we have API changes.

For more information about our CLI check out the documentation: https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/newrelic-cli/

Below is a list of use-cases you will be able to solve with the CLI. We want you to create an example command for each and add it to [this Google form](https://forms.gle/1K5SL2WGsrko8xxD9). We will check each of the commands, and the person with the most correct answers will get some exclusive swag.
